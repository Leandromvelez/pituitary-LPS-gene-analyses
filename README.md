# pituitary-LPS-gene-analyses
## This repository details gene expression analyses from Castro-Garcia, Velez et al. 2023
### Analyses are broken into two parts:
#### 1. Module detection, differential expression and integration of LPS-induced genes in mouse pituitary: WGCNA and DE from LPS induction.R
#### 2. Integration of LPS DEGs with GTEx dataset: GTEx integration of LPS DEGs.R

### Datasets used in this study are available here:
